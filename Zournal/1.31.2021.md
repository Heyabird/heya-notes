Dear Steve,

I have a few things to thank you for.

Thank you for allowing me to learn how to be more honest. You have always been a safe space for me to express myself and accepting of how I feel. And thank you for being so honest with me as well. That itself pushes me to being more shamelessly who I am. I have a far way to go, but I am grateful that I get to grow with you.

Thank you also for being such a kind and warm soul. I'm especially touched by how much I can trust you, how much I know that you are going to be there for me. You are someone with many special talents, but I hope you know how special your heart is. The world is so lucky to have you, your beautiful soul, and your care for your family, friends, and society.

I'm so grateful to have met you, as I have become better through you, and, hopefully, with you.

With Love,
Heya
